           <div> <p>I grew up in <b>Half Moon Bay</b>, California near <b>San Francisco</b> until I was 28 years old. I wanted to play sports like basketball and football in high school. I delivered pizza after I graduated. I was in the Marine Corps for four years in Hawaii afterwards. It was tough but nothing I could not accomplish. In the military I learned to adapt to dynamic situations.</head>

        After the military I went to <strong>Mesa College and University of San Diego</strong> earning degrees in Political Science and International Relations. Now I work for a private security company. I want to travel around the country and the world and work remotly from hotel rooms while earning a high salary. Software Development is interesting to me so I now take classes to learn the skill.
